Kyrgyzstan Election App
This is a web application for the Kyrgyzstan election process. The app allows a user to log in using their passport ID, view a list of political parties, and select a party to view the candidates. The user can then select a candidate to vote for, and a snackbar will appear thanking them for participating in the election.

Installation
To use the app, simply navigate to the login page and enter your passport ID. If you do not have a passport ID, you will not be able to use the app.

Usage
Once you have logged in, you will be taken to the list of political parties. Select a party to view the candidates, and then select a candidate to vote for. Once you have made your selection, a snackbar will appear thanking you for participating in the election.
